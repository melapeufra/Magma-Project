# Magma-Project
☺ RSA examples using MAGMA. By using random prime p and q and then we calculate phi, e(for encryption) and d(for decryption).
☺ In the second example we use the Divisors function together with the reduction of sequences to find the first few perfect numbers, that is numbers n such that the sum of the divisors less than n equals n.
☺ Last examples we made a cyclic code that shows cyclic linear code and its generator matrix, and then we calculated its dual to show a repeating code Generator Matrix,
We also calculate BCH Code, Galois field, a Prime number, Reed Solomon Code ,Polynomial Ring and Factorization.
